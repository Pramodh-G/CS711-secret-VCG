# CS711-secret-VCG

This repository stores the implementation that we did as a part of our project work on Distributed Mechanism Design using Blockchains for the course on Game Theory and Mechanism Design (CS711).  
The **Secret Contract** Folder stores the instructions to run Secret Contract based auctions and **Smart Contract** folder contains the instructions
to run the Smart Contract based auctions.
